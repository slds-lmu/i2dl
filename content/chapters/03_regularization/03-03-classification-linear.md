## Which statements are true? 

- [x] Classification is part of supervised learning.
- [ ] Scoring classifiers always output numbers between 0 and 1.
- [x] Probabilistic classifiers always output numbers between 0 and 1.
- [x] With scoring classifiers one can obtain class labels by using a threshold.
- [ ] The decision boundary does not depend on the model used.

## Which statements are true? 

- [x] For the discriminant approach we must have a loss function for minimization.
- [ ] The generative and discriminant approach are basically the same.
- [x] The generative approach is a probabilistic approach.
- [ ] Binary classification uses two discriminant functions.
- [ ] Linear classifiers can just learn linear decision boundaries.
- [x] Logistic regression is an example for the discriminant approach.
- [x] Linear classifiers specify the discriminant function with linear functions.

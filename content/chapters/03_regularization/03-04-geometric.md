title: "Chapter 03.04: Geometric Analysis of L2 Regularization and Weight Decay"
weight: 3004
---
In this section, we provide a geometric understanding of \\(L2\\) regularization, showing how parameters are shrunk according to the eigenvalues of the Hessian of empirical risk, and discuss its correspondence to weight decay.

title: "Chapter 05.04: CNN Components"
weight: 5004
---
This subchapter covers fundamental components of CNNs such as input channels, padding, stride, and pooling layers. Padding and stride settings control the dimensions and details retained in feature maps, while pooling layers i.a. reduce data size and improve computational efficiency. Together, these components enable CNNs to handle high-dimensional data effectively, capturing both local and global patterns in images.

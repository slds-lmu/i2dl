This chapter introduce --convolution neural networks (CNNs)-- one of the most popular component of deep learning architecture. CNNs are widely applied in other domains such as natural language processing (NLP), audio, and time-series data. In this part, we introduce the CNNs, properties and component of CNN, differences between CNN and FCN as well as math behind the CNNs.

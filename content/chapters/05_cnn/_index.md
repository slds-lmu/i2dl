title: "Topic 05: Convolutional Neural Networks - Part I"
---
This chapter introduce --convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-- one of the most popular component of deep learning architecture. CNNs are widely applied in all type of domains such as natural language processing (NLP), audio, and time-series data. In this part, we introduce the CNNs, properties and components of CNN, differences between CNN and FCN as well as math behind the CNNs.

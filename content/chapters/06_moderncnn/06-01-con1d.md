weight: 6001
---
In this subchapter we present the various types of convolutions in CNNs — 1D, 2D, and 3D — each suited for specific data structures and applications. One-dimensional convolutions process sequential data like time series, two-dimensional convolutions handle spatial data like images, and three-dimensional convolutions analyze volumetric data like videos or MRI scans.

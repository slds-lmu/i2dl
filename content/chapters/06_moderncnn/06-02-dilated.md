title: "Chapter 06.02: Dilated Convolutions and Transposed Convolutions"
weight: 6002
---
This subchapter explores dilated and transposed convolutions, specialized types of convolutional operations in CNNs. Dilated convolutions expand the receptive field without increasing the number of parameters, whereas transposed convolutions upsample data by increasing feature map dimensions, often used in applications requiring higher resolution outputs.

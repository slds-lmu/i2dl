title: "Chapter 08: Autoencoders"
---
This chapter introduces unsupervised learning with a focus on autoencoders (AEs), which learn compact representations of data without labeled outputs. It explains the structure of AEs, including encoder-decoder frameworks and their use in dimensionality reduction and feature extraction. The chapter also explores regularized variants such as overcomplete, sparse, denoising, and contractive AEs, highlighting their unique roles in improving representation quality. Finally, it covers convolutional AEs for image data and manifold learning concepts.

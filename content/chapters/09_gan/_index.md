title: "Topic 09: Generative Adversarial Neural Networks"
---
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of machine learning models that consist of two competing networks: a generator, which creates data samples, and a discriminator, which evaluates their authenticity. This chapter introduces the core principles of GANs, explores popular variants and addresses challenges in optimizing them.
